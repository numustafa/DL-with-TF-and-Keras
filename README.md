# DL-with-TF-and-Keras
This Repo contains all the files from my course `Deep Learning with TensorFlow & keras` with [OpenCV University](https://opencv.org/university/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-keras/). The whole module includes:
1. Basics of TensorFlow
2. Neural Network modules - Build non-Linear neural Network
3. ML processes - Concepts and practical approach to solve Computer Vision problem with Deep Learning & classical ML methods
3. Optimization - using Gradient Descent method to solve and optimize a Computer Vision problem
4. Rivison of Linear Regression - For building basics in Linear Neural Network ( how a normal eqn can be solved analytically by a single layered - single neuron Neural network)
