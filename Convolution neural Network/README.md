# Convolution neural Network    
This module is a basis for upcomming modules such as semantic segmantation, object detection and instance segmantation. The module is begin by taking a look at a performance of a well known model called "RESNet50" by Microsoft. After basic examples, like a pretrained models from keras API on imagenet dataset and used them to perform inference on the test images, the module covers various layers and building blocks that are used in CNN.
This module also focuses on building a CNN model using keras API, LENet 5 CNN architecture. 
This module also covers the concept of building models using sequential API and functional API, from Keras. This module allows to work independently on custom datasets, save trained models and callback saved models while training.
Revisit the concept of **Overfitting**, and looks at various techniques, such as data augmentation, to avoid or reduce overfitting.  
Conclude this module by looking at the concept of **Transfer Learning** and **Fine Tuning**.
* Transfer Learning: Use a pretrained model, trained on a large dataset, and use it to perform inference on a new dataset through some fine tuning of the pretrained model.
