# Neural Network
This folder contains the assessment files for the Neural Network module. The module covers the following topics:
1. Neural Network Basics - Structure & Architecture of a Neural Network
2. Understand the role of different components of a Neural Network, such as Neurons, Activation Functions, Layers, Weights, Bias, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, Loss Function, Cost Function, Gradient Descent, etc.
3. Understand the role of different Hyperparameters of a Neural Network, such as Learning Rate, Number of Epochs, Batch Size, etc.
4. Feature Scaling and Normalization - Standardization and Min-Max Scaling
5. Model any real-world problem using a Neural Network, with 2 components, i.e., non-linear activation function and hidden Layers.
6. Understand the difference b/w regression and classification problems, and how to model them using a Neural Network.
